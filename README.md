## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an HR analytics dashboard using Power BI to analyze workforce dynamics and attrition trends. The goal is to provide HR professionals with actionable insights to enhance employee retention and improve workforce management.

## Objectives
- Analyze attrition rates across various dimensions (education, age, salary, job role, years at company).
- Identify key factors influencing employee attrition.
- Provide insights into gender ratio, marital status, and department headcount.
- Help HR professionals make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preparation.

## Data Sources
- **Employee Data**: Includes details such as age, gender, education, job role, salary, and years at the company.
- **Attrition Data**: Information on employees who have left the company, including reasons and duration of employment.

## Key Insights
